## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.9.6)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghelle8/Hangman916.git
```
### Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd YourHangmanRepository
```
### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On MacOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Run the Hangman game
Now you're all set! Start playing the Hangman game by following the instructions in the Usage section.

## Usage
### Word Selection
The computer selects a random word from a predefined list of fruits:
```python
import random

word_list = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Strawberry", "Pineapple"]
word = random.choice(word_list)

```
### User Input and Validation

The user is prompted to enter a single letter, and the input is validated to ensure it is a valid single alphabetical character.
```python
# Ask the user to enter a single letter
guess = input("Please enter a single letter: ")

# Check if the input is a single letter and alphabetical
if len(guess) == 1 and guess.isalpha():
    print("Good Guess!:", guess)
else:
    print("Oops! That is not a valid input.")

# Display the entered letter
print("You entered:", guess)
```
### Game Logic

The game logic is encapsulated in functions. The check_guess function checks if the guessed letter is in the word, and the ask_for_input function handles the user input and game loop.

#### check_guess(secret_word, guess)
This function checks if the guessed letter is in the word. If the guess is correct, it updates the word_guessed list.
```python
def check_guess(secret_word, guess):
    # Game logic details...
```

#### ask_for_input()
This function contains the game loop, prompting the user for guesses until they run out of lives or successfully guess the word.
``` python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the ask_for_input function to start the game
    ask_for_input()
```
